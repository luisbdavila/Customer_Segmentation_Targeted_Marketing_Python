# Cluser Segmentation

In this project, we will tackle the task of seggregating and profiling customers of a retail store based on a dataset which include data on customers' spending habits as well as data regarding information about the customer, such as their birthdate and gender.

For clarity, this project has been split into multiple notebooks which work in a chain-like way where data is exported from one notebook to the next. For this reason, in theory, it is better to run all notebooks in the following order: 
1) Project_preprocessing(in the Pre-procesing folder) 
2) Project Geo_Analysis(in the Geo-Analysis folder)
3) Project_clustering(in the Modelling folder)
4) Project_cluster_analysis(in the Modelling folder)
5) Project_Association_Rules(in the Association Rules folder). 

For more practical ease of use all of the datasets that are exported and required in future notebooks have been exported to the datasets folder allowing for the option to run one notebook without having to run all of the previous ones.

The name of each folder and file says exacly what you will encounter inside.
